Glitch Entertainment is a small team working to create amazing stories and beautiful worlds like no other. If you want a tl;dr for all that you're probably not going to read, **we are Glitch and we are here to make some cool games.** That being said, it may be important to say we gave one guy too much freedom in writing these blurbs.

### Who We Are
- **We are people who â™¥ Open Source.** Open-source software helps fuel our work and empowers our games to be amazing. We give back to the community by open-sourcing some of our work, such as our game SDKs and this website. You can view all our [licensing here](/licenses).
- **We are creative and talented people.** Our team is, put in the best way to avoid feeding anyone's egos, amazing. We give our games 110% of our effort and ensure they are nutured into being amazing experiences that will want you to keep coming back for more.
- **We are welcoming.** Frankly, we could careless about your background (unless you're a certified bad guy, then we'd care a little bit). We appreciate each and everyone of the people on our team and everyone who contributes to our open-source projects.

Put simply, **we are Glitch.**
