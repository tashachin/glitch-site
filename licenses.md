We &#9829; open-source. It's what fuels are work and allows us to create our amazing games. For that reason, when we feel like a part of a game could be used by others, we release it on GitHub under an open-source license to help others have the tools they need to do amazing things. Of course, for other things, like our games, we need to use stricter licensing to ensure that our hard-work pays off.

- **Southpine**, as of writing, is planned to be closed-source. We will still mention all the amazing open-source works we used in the credits of the game.
- The **Southpine SDK** is completely open-source to allow mod developers to know exactly what they can do. The SDK can be found at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/playglitch/southpine-sdk) and is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license, which you can [learn more about here](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
- The **Southpine Player API** is completely open-source to allow developers to know exactly what they can do. The API can be found at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/playglitch/southpine-api) and is licensed the BSD 3-Clause license, which you can [learn more about here](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
- The **Glitch Entertainment website** is completely open-source to allow others to help improve our site and make it better for everyone. It's source can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/playglitch/glitch-site) and is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License, which you can [learn more about here](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).

People in our community have made some amazing things and, because of that, we wanted to show some love and mention some of them.

- The SouthNode, SouthPy, and SouthJS API wrappers for Node.js, Python, and vanilla JavaScript (respectively) were developed and maintained by [doamatto](https://doamatto.xyz)
